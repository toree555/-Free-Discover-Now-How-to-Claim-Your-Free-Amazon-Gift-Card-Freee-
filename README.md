Amazon gift cards are prepaid cards that allow you to shop on Amazon.com or affiliated websites. You can redeem gift card codes online for purchases or add the balance to your Amazon account for later use. Amazon offers both physical and digital gift cards, and the amount is usually chosen by the buyer. You can use your gift card on almost anything sold on Amazon, including subscriptions, books, gadgets, and more.

Free Amazon gift cards can be earned through various methods, such as online surveys, cashback apps, and loyalty programs. The best part? You donâ€™t have to spend any of your own money to get them!
